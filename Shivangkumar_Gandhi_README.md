## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this lab / assingnment / project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software / libraries / plug-ins


#### Dependencies Required:

```
npm install material-ui
npm install @material-ui/core
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material
npm install @mui/x-date-pickers
npm install react-hook-form
npm install react-router-dom
npm install axios
```


See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running


```
npm install material-ui
npm install @material-ui/core
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material
npm install @mui/x-date-pickers
npm install react-hook-form
npm install react-router-dom
npm install axios
npm run build
npm start
```

After these commands the app is launched on the localhost.
Following can be seen in the terminal: 

> Compiled successfully!

> You can now view add_medical_records_task in the browser.

>  Local:            http://localhost:3000
>  On Your Network:  http://192.168.137.1:3000

>Note that the development build is not optimized.
>To create a production build, use npm run build.

>webpack compiled successfully

## Built With

* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The web framework used


## Sources Used

I used Axios Documentation to refer the syntax and usage of axios for dealing with APIs, refering the webiste [Axios](https://axios-http.com/). 

- <!---How---> The code in [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) was implemented by Shivang by using get, post requests.
- <!---Why---> [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) was used because they are open source libraries for http requests.
- <!---How---> [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) Code was modified by just using the get and post statements. The responses were handled for the use cases of tutorial 4.

I used Material UI library as I used React JS, adapting the code in [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) the official website for documentation as shown below: 

- <!---How---> The code in [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) was implemented by Shivanh by rendering inbuilt components like Grid, TextField, Buttons, etc. and their attributes and syntaxes.
- <!---Why---> [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)'s components was used because they are universal and used in mostly every React JS projects.
- <!---How---> [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)'s Code was modified by changing the properties and also the logic behind the rendering of components and validation techniques. They are just the UI components like Texfield, Button, Container, etc.
